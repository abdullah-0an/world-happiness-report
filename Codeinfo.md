# 📊 **World Happiness Data**

### **Overview**

This project focuses on exploring, preprocessing, and modeling the **World Happiness Report 2024** dataset to predict happiness scores and understand the key factors that contribute to global well-being. The notebook will guide you through the following steps:

1. **Explore the Data**: Gain an understanding of the dataset’s structure, inspect data types, and identify relationships between variables.
2. **Handle Missing Values**: Effectively address missing or incomplete data using appropriate imputation techniques.
3. **Preprocess the Data**: Clean and prepare the data for machine learning models by scaling, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **Build a Neural Network**: Construct and train a neural network model to predict happiness scores based on the provided features.
5. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the model's performance using suitable evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and others depending on the type of task.

### **Steps Involved**

#### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Investigate the dataset's basic statistics.
   - Visualize distributions and correlations between features to identify potential relationships.
   - Understand how different factors affect happiness scores.

#### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Address missing data and outliers.
   - Apply data normalization or standardization to prepare the features for modeling.
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical values (if necessary).

#### 3. **Model Building**
   - Construct a **Neural Network** using a deep learning framework like Keras or TensorFlow.
   - Tune the model architecture and hyperparameters to optimize performance.

#### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Use evaluation metrics such as loss functions and accuracy to gauge the model’s effectiveness.
   - Compare the predicted happiness scores with actual values to check the model's prediction capabilities.
